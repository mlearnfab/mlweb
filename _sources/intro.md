**Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners** is a free online program designed for busy professionals who want to learn Data Science quickly and efficiently.  It is part of a series which includes Python for Absolute Beginners and Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners.

Unlike most offerings, the course combines self-paced material with live interactive sessions. The course design is based on principles of active learning. Our goal is to teach you computation skills and the power of abstract thinking, not simply coding. The course was especially designed for those interested in Data Science and Machine Learning careers.
